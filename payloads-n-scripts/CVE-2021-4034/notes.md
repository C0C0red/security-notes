# Notes

Relevant when Linpeas shows:

```
Vulnerable to CVE-2021-4034
```
in orange.

Use the `Make all` command with these files from your Kali machine.


then, copy `exploit` and `evil.so` to your target-box.
Run `chmod 700 exploit` to allow you to run the exploit, and then you run `./exploit`.
You are now root.

The `-static` flag in the `gcc` build command is what makes it possible to compile it from your own kali machine.
This can also be necessary with other executables, such as the `44298.c` program from searchsploit.
