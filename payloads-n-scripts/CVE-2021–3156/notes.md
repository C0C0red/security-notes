# Notes

For certain distros of Linux, sudo versions below 1.8.31 were vulnerable to this exploit.

If you run

```
sudoedit -s /
```

and see "`not a regular file`", sudo is vulnerable

the exploit can be found [here](https://github.com/mohinparamasivam/Sudo-1.8.31-Root-Exploit).

Get this exploit to the target box  and `make`.
now, run `./exploit` and you are root.

Alternatively, you can compile the files on your kali from the copies of the files in this repo (I have simply added `-static` to the make commands).
Now transfer the binary to the target and execute it.
