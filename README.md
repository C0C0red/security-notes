# security-notes

Markdown repo for notes on all things cyber-security.
I made it to centralize my notes I had in various places from practicing red-teaming. 
Anyone finding this is free to use the command-snippits for the own learning and research,
But I take no responsibility that may occur as a result. Furthermore, only use the tooling here for legal purposes.
